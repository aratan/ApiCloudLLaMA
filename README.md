# ApiCloudLLaMA
The idea is to make an api that everyone can consume in their GPT4-like applications but with free models, to democratize its use.

Thought in a modular system that reminds me of the shirts that are clicked in arduino for extra functions.

We use our application on the LLaMA executable, providing an Api with queue service.
